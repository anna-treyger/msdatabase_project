**DBS project for an introductory database management systems course**

My team and I created a database using SQL queries for a fictionalized book club.

**Overview:**

**Purpose of the Database:**

• Monitor book club activities, including student participation, discussions, and reviews.

• Organize book lists, recommendations, and student interactions within the club.

**Importance of the Database:**

• Establishes a centralized system to manage all club operations.

• Enables accurate tracking of books, student involvement, and memberships.

• Records book discussions, recommendations, and reviews efficiently.


**Acknowledgement of team efforts:**
