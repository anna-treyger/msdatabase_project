# Book Club Database in Microsoft Access using SQL

**DBMS project for an introductory database management systems course**

My team and I created a database using SQL queries for a fictionalized book club.

**Overview:**

**Purpose of the Database:**

- Monitor book club activities, including student participation, discussions, and reviews.
- Organize book lists, recommendations, and student interactions within the club.

**Importance of the Database:**

- Establishes a centralized system to manage all club operations.
- Enables accurate tracking of books, student involvement, and memberships.
- Records book discussions, recommendations, and reviews efficiently.

**How to run:**

- Open the Book Club Database MS Access (Updated).accdb file in Microsoft Access
- If you have issues with the permissions or are blocked from performing certain functions, try updating your Trust Center settings.

**Example of query and output:**
